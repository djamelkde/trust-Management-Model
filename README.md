# A Trust Management Model for The Internet of Things
This source code is our Trust management model for the IoT developped on JAVA. 
This model covers only the mathematical concepts behind the compution of the reputation of IoT devices. In this project, we have been done a lot of simulations with playing on different parameters of the model. The obtained results matche with our expected theoretical results. 
 
For more information about our model, please refer to our original paper: https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/9120287
